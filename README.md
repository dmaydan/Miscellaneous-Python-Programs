# UNO and Other Miscellaneous Python Programs
This repository contains implementations of several dice games (400 Meters, Discus, Shot Put, Dino Hunt), as well as implementations of dominoes, UNO, and the railfence cipher. The UNO program took by far the most time and is also the largest of the 7 programs in terms of number of lines (430). The Discus, Shot Put, and 400 Meters games have a <code>tkinter</code> GUI. The rest of the programs can be played directly from the command line.
